# Hello and welcome to my profile.
My name is Sascha T., and I have been developing programs varying from small chat clients/servers to websites (full-stack) to game modifications for quite a few years now.
I live in a small town in rural southern Germany and am currently attending a local Gymnasium.

# My favourite programming languages
Some of my favourite to-use programming languages are, depending on the task:
- Java (GraalVM, Desktop, Minecraft Modding etc.)
- Javascript (NodeJS, Typescript, Electron, React)
- C/C++ (Previous unpublished operating system development escapades)

Though I have also, in some capacity, used in the past:
- GoLang
- Rust
- Lua
- C#/VB.net
